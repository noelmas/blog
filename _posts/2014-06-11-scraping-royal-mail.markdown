Earlier in the week I had to find a list of all addresses on a given street. After chasing a few deadends that involved vists to the Ordnance Survey website and having a look if the Google Maps API could help, I found a neat trick that uses the most authoratitive source for this kind of information: [Royal Mail](http://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode).

The screencast below shows how to do it using the Google Chrome [Scraper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scraper/mbigbapnjcgaffohmbkdlecaccepngjd) plug-in. It's a bit of a hack and doesn't give you all flat addresses in one table, but is a great start for grabbing this kind of information.
