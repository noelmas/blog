This tip comes courtesy of Paul Myers runs the brilliant [Research Clinic website](http://researchclinic.net/) that has a range of similar techniques for investigative reporters.

A core part of journalism involves contacting people for the purposes of a story. It can often be difficult get hold of direct email addresses. One option is to intelligently guess them. In order to do this, you need to know the email and domain pattern that the organisation your individual is linked to uses. This is where [Email-Format.com](http://email-format.com/) comes in. You can search for any organisation and identify the format used for emails. Take the Open Knowledge Foundaiton for example - [http://email-format.com/d/okfn.org/](http://email-format.com/d/okfn.org/). If you know that my name is Sam Leon, it's pretty straight forward to get my email address.
