        <title>Joining the dots - From property deals at the Trump Ocean Club, Panama to Latin American drug cartels</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In October Global Witness’ investigation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club, Panama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exposed how profits from Colombian cartels were trafficked through the purchase of real estate units at a Panama property development which Donald Trump made millions selling his name to. The investigation was based on months of research, interviews and in-depth data work on public sources including the Panamanian Company Registry, the Panamanian Land Registry and OpenCorporates.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post describes in broad brush strokes some of the steps we took in the data research for &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt;. It outlines how we built programmes that took raw data from OpenCorporates.com and turned it into something that the broader investigative team could visually explore, verify and then incorporate into their final story. The scripts could be re-run quickly whenever the underlying data was changed, for example, when new companies of interest were identified as having been involved in purchasing property. The approaches outlined here are becoming increasingly central to how organisations like ours collaborate around digital sources and data to expose corruption more effectively in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automating-searches-for-relevant-companies-using-opencorporates&quot;&gt;Automating searches for relevant companies using OpenCorporates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using scripts that automatically queried OpenCorporates we were able to incorporate much larger sets of information in our research than would be allowed by manual extraction. OpenCorporates is the world’s largest open database of company information; it contains the records on over 138 million companies registered in a huge range of jurisdictions. As well as offering web-based search it also offers a number of tools to data journalists via its &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.opencorporates.com/&quot;&gt;Application Programming Interface (API)&lt;/a&gt; to help them find, extract and connect large numbers of companies in automated workflows. In some cases this can substantially reduce the amount of time required to do investigative tasks. For instance, extracting all the companies a given individual is a director of can be automated via writing a simple computer script. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt; we used this to identify companies that had been created apparently in order to purchase properties at Trump Ocean Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-network-analysis-tools---neo4j-and-linkurious---to-reveal-patterns-in-the-data&quot;&gt;Using network analysis tools - Neo4J and Linkurious - to reveal patterns in the data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used a visualisation tool called Linkurious that enables us to share and spot patterns that would otherwise be difficult to detect if just looking at tables and statistics. As is the case in many Global Witness investigations, our core dataset on &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt; was made of properties, people and companies that represented a complicated real world network. This network had certain features that were of interest to our researchers. For example, we wanted to know which people directed the most property-purchasing companies and who else the companies were connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to find this out and explore the connections in our data we used a database tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://neo4j.com/&quot;&gt;Neo4J&lt;/a&gt; and an exploration technology, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkurio.us/&quot;&gt;Linkurious&lt;/a&gt;. This tool stack was also used by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists to interrogate the data contained within both the Panama and Paradise Papers and now powers their &lt;a href=&quot;https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/&quot;&gt;Offshore Leaks site&lt;/a&gt;. While the dataset for &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt; was much smaller than either of these gigantic leaks, these tools helped us to do three things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it enabled us to quantify and see how individuals of interest, such as Alexandre Ventura Nogueira, were connected to companies apparently used to purchase properties at the Trump Ocean Club, Panama:. Second, it allowed us to gain a different perspective on our data. Data visualisation has long been understood in statistics as not simply about generating pretty insights, but also integral to the process of data exploration (for those who haven’t seen it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet&quot;&gt;Anscombe’s quartet&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful illustration of this). Third, it allowed us to provide an interactive snapshot of some limited portions of our data when we published the report online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://linkurious.globalwitness.org/widget/8bb8e819&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interactive above illustrates the networks we found using OpenCorporates and network analysis tool, Linkurious. It shows some of the directors, officers, agents, and subscribers of 7 Homes companies discussed in our investigation Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club, Panama. Click on the companies to find out more information about them. Company and officer data was extracted from OpenCorporates and verified in the original Panamanian company registry. Read the full report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/narco-a-lago-panama/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis is reproducible if you can reach the same conclusions or make the same inferences based on the same data. The importance of reproducibility to the development of modern science has been understood for at least three centuries. It is the means through which the conclusion of one person or group can be tested and interrogated by others. As more journalism becomes dependent on data sources, the tools used for doing reproducible analysis in the sciences have started to be applied to investigations. These tools help data journalists and the teams they are working with move from the raw data to their conclusions, documenting each step on the way. For those wanting a good explanation of the key components to a reproducible analysis that can be shared with others, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing&quot;&gt;see Jeff Leek&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering at the Trump Ocean Club Panama&lt;/em&gt; all our analysis was written in the easy-to-learn programming language Python and stored as a reproducible script in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt;. This had three key advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the underlying data was changed (for instance we identified new companies that had been set up with the apparent intention of being used to purchase Trump Ocean Club properties) the analysis could be re-run at the click of a button. This saved us time and reduced the possibility of introducing error by re-doing the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every step that we took extracting, cleaning and analysing the data was written out in plain non-technical English so that we developed a record of each assumption we made. This meant that lawyers, researchers and investigators could understand and agree on the chosen approach. Having the analysis organised and stored in this fashion is also very helpful later down the line when revisiting an analysis that was undertaken previously. Anyone who has undertaken complicated data transformation and analysis using Excel will know how easy it is to lose track of the steps taken to arrive at your final analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jupyter Notebooks can easily be shared within a team and published online in conjunction with a story. This enables others to rerun your analysis and understand the exact steps you took to reach your conclusions. Code sharing sites like Github now render them and any visuals so that they no longer require specialist software to view. You can see our recent analysis of property owned by offshore companies in England and Wales in the form of a Jupyter Notebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/overseas_companies_land_ownership/blob/master/overseas_companies_land_ownership_analysis.ipynb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The 86,000 secretly owned properties in England and Wales</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/two-years-still-dark-about-86000-anonymously-owned-uk-homes/&quot;&gt;originally published on the Global Witness blog&lt;/a&gt; and was co-written with my colleague Naomi Hirst.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 David Cameron issued a threat to the corrupt, declaring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-new-global-commitments-to-expose-punish-and-drive-out-corruption&quot;&gt;‘London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to stop dirty money from being funnelled into the country through anonymously owned companies his Government promised to create a public register naming the real owners of all overseas companies that own UK properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, despite making the commitment again in front of over 40 governments at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-new-global-commitments-to-expose-punish-and-drive-out-corruption&quot;&gt;International Anti-Corruption Summit&lt;/a&gt; just last year, and in the face of widespread domestic support for making the UK property market more transparent, progress has stalled. We’re two years on and the register is nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe the British government know better than us? Maybe after the tough talk at the Summit all the secret beneficiaries left the shadows and incorporated companies in plain sight. It’s possible, right…?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out whether or not we were barking up the wrong tree, we joined forces with friends at Who Owns England? and Transparency International UK to look at the most recent Land Registry data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, our analysis found that since the property register was promised, nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still in the dark about the 86,000+ UK properties that are owned by anonymous companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As initially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-average-estate-agents-commission-on-a-1m-sale-is-20-000-the-average-fine-for-money-laundering-breaches-is-1-134-sjc5hch05&quot;&gt;published in The Times&lt;/a&gt;, our joint analysis found that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret ownership of property in England and Wales remains virtually unchanged since 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The total number of properties owned by companies incorporated in secrecy jurisdictions remains virtually unchanged from late 2015, at &lt;strong&gt;86,000&lt;/strong&gt; - suggesting the Government’s rhetoric has had little effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As was the case in 2015, &lt;strong&gt;87%&lt;/strong&gt; of all properties owned by overseas companies have an owner in jurisdictions which keep information about the real people behind the company secret.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tens of thousands of properties are owned through companies incorporated in the highly secretive British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;57,000 properties are owned by companies registered in British Overseas Territories &amp;amp; Crown Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt; - including places like the British Virgin Islands, Jersey, and the Isle of Man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the most expensive UK property sales in recent years have been made via companies incorporated in secrecy jurisdictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the Land Registry, the most expensive property owned by a company based in secrecy jurisdiction is 123 Buckingham Palace Road which is worth &lt;strong&gt;£215,399,999&lt;/strong&gt; and owned by a Jersey-based company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top 10 most expensive properties owned by companies in secrecy jurisdictions are worth over £1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use of companies incorporated in secrecy jurisdictions to purchase property is increasing in some areas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2015 the London borough of &lt;strong&gt;Tower Hamlets has seen an 11% increase&lt;/strong&gt; in the number of properties owned by companies incorporated by secrecy jurisdictions, meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;Greater Manchester has experienced a 10% increase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secret ownership of property remains especially high in the London boroughs of Kensington &amp;amp; Chelsea and the City of Westminster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;City of Westminster over 10,000 properties&lt;/strong&gt; are owned anonymously whilst in the &lt;strong&gt;Royal Borough of Kensington &amp;amp; Chelsea the tally almost 6,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;max-width:900px&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rOQBW/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;602&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new findings tell us that the need for a property register remains as strong as ever. And as we approach International Anti-Corruption Day, all eyes are on Margot James as Minister for Corporate Responsibility to fulfil the commitment the Government made to citizens and to leaders from around the world to get dirty money out of the UK property market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproduce our analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those wanting to reproduce our analysis, expand upon it or understand more about our approach, the code is available as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/overseas_companies_land_ownership/blob/master/overseas_companies_land_ownership_analysis.ipynb&quot;&gt;Jupyter notebook via Github&lt;/a&gt;. The Land Registry data (accurate as of October 2017) that we used for this analysis has now been published freely, but you will still need to go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-overseas-companies-ownership-data&quot;&gt;steps to download it&lt;/a&gt; in order to reproduce our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These findings are based on the Land Registry’s Overseas Ownership Dataset as initially received and processed by Global Witness. This dataset is now available free of charge at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-overseas-companies-ownership-data&quot;&gt;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-overseas-companies-ownership-data  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Secrecy jurisdiction” is a term used as an alternative to the more widely used term tax havens. These jurisdictions use secrecy to attract illicit and illegitimate or abusive financial flows. This analysis deems any jurisdiction with a “financial secrecy score” of 60 and above in the Tax Justice Network’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results&quot;&gt;Financial Secrecy Index&lt;/a&gt; to be a secrecy jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Top 6 workshops from NICAR 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to attend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ire.org/nicar/&quot;&gt;NICAR&lt;/a&gt; this year - the largest gathering of data journalists worldwide and all-round geek fest. A mind-boggling array of workshops and events were on offer covering the broad range of techniques used by journalists to investigate and present topics using data. These were my top 5 sessions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robroc/GIS-with-python&quot;&gt;top 5 Python libraries for working with geospatial data&lt;/a&gt; - A whirlwind tour from Roberto Rocha of the 5 best libraries for building a powerful but efficient workflows for analysing, wrangling and presenting geospatial data. It included easy starter code snippets wrapped up in a single Jupyter/notebook presentation to boot. &lt;a href=&quot;http://geopandas.org/&quot;&gt;Geopandas&lt;/a&gt; is already proving an invaluable tool in my day-to-day. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robroc/GIS-with-python&quot;&gt;https://github.com/robroc/GIS-with-python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Michelle Borkin’s talk on the cognition of data visualisation based on a large scale experiment which tracked the responses, recall and eye-movements of volunteers exposed to hundreds of static infographics and charts. Some of the findings were surprising and counter to the lauded Tufte’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php/Data-Ink_Ratio&quot;&gt;data-ink ratio paradigm&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, Borkin found that information redundnacy in charts positively influenced particiapnts’ recall and understanding. The whole dataset for the project including has been released for openly as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://massvis.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Massvis Dataset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A quick introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://flourish.studio/&quot;&gt;Kiln’s Flourish Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Kiln founder Duncan Clarke demoed the new platform for publishing interactive data visualisations that combines re-usability, clean GUI interfaces for data updating whilst allowing for radical creativity in the design process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buzzfeed’s Open Labs Fellows’ crash course in mining data from social media sources including Facebook and Twitter with a handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/big-picture/wiki/Guide:-Harvesting-social-data&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt; of scripts to get you started on coding up your own scrapers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/big-picture/wiki/Guide:-Harvesting-social-data&quot;&gt;https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/big-picture/wiki/Guide:-Harvesting-social-data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meredith Broussard (New York University) and William Lyon (Neo4J) demonstrated how the network database Neo4J can be used to explore campaign finance. ICIJ have showed through the Panama Papers the power of Neo4J for investigating and presenting complex networks. Neo4J now runs a journalism accelerator programme to encourage uptake by newsrooms. More info &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/neo4j_ddj&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neil Halloran - the creator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/128373915&quot;&gt;Fallen of World War II&lt;/a&gt; - gave wide-ranging talk on the natural tension between statistics and sentiment and how we can do a better job at marrying gate two. Including some great links to further reading that I will follow up on: Steven Pinker’s &lt;em&gt;The Better Angels of Our Nature&lt;/em&gt; and Daniel Kahneman’s &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast &amp;amp; Slow&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s a link to the amazing visual data story if you haven’t seen it already:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrys Wu has helpfully pulled together the various tip sheets and slide decks from some of the other sessions: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.chryswu.com/2017/03/02/nicar17-slides-links-tutorials-nicar17/&quot;&gt;http://blog.chryswu.com/2017/03/02/nicar17-slides-links-tutorials-nicar17/&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in getting involved there is a very active disucssion list &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ire.org/resource-center/listservs/subscribe-nicar-l/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive thanks to all the organisers and stalwarts of the Nicar community for facilitating such a brilliant exchange of stories, skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mining the UK register of beneficial ownership</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;UK companies with hidden owners lie behind some of the worst problems of our time. Amongst other things they have been used to breach UN sanctions, evade taxes and rip off ordinary citizens. That’s why Global Witness has been calling for an end to these getaway cars for crime and corruption for years (see this &lt;a href=&quot;http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-exposing-anonymous-companies-could-cut-down-on-crime-global-witness&quot;&gt;TED-Ed animation&lt;/a&gt; for a short introduction to the issue). Now, we’re seeing the first seeds of change - in June, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://companieshouse.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/13/the-new-people-with-significant-control-register/&quot;&gt;UK government started publishing&lt;/a&gt; the world’s first open data register of the real owners and controllers of companies – known as “beneficial owners”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a big step forward for transparency in this country, and a potential treasure trove of information - but we need to make sense of it first. Which is why we’ve collaborated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-uk&quot;&gt;DataKind UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencorporates.com/&quot;&gt;OpenCorporates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spendnetwork.com/&quot;&gt;Spend Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en&quot;&gt;OCCRP&lt;/a&gt;, to probe it in detail, and give feedback on how useful it is. So on a grey autumn weekend in London, we brought together thirty volunteer data scientists, including the head of software for a Formula 1 team, an astrophysicist and a former consultant to the UK tax authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had three aims for the weekend. Firstly, we wanted to get some basic insights into this data and what it could tell us about companies in the UK. Secondly, it was important to understand the flaws and gaps in the new register. Finally, we were curious to see whether the register could yield investigative leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a snapshot of what we found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost 3,000 companies listed their beneficial owner as a company with a tax haven address - something that is not allowed under the rules. There are problems with how the data has been inputted. For example, you can write anything in the nationality field and we found over 500 ways of putting “British”, including ten people who wrote “Cornish”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;76 beneficial owners share the same name and birthday as someone on the U.S. sanctions list. We have to do more digging to find out whether these are actually the same people, but it’s an insight into what is possible with this new information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most beneficial owners are from the UK, followed by a number from other European countries and India and China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insights&quot;&gt;Insights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data allows us to start to understand the complex ecosystem of companies and their owners in the UK - where they’re from, and what other companies they own. In theory, law enforcement agencies, journalists and civil society being able to map this stuff out will make it much harder for those with something to hide to do so behind layers and layers of secret companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new system, companies have to provide ownership information once a year when they send in their annual return or “confirmation statement”. Out of 3.5 million companies, 1.3 million have already filed beneficial ownership information as of 17 November. Most beneficial owners (1.2 million) are British. Perhaps unsurprisingly when you take the British out of the mix, Irish is the next biggest nationality, followed by a mix of European countries (Italy and Poland) and the two mega-economies of China and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org//media/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-19_at_22.07.18.width-1280.png&quot; alt=&quot;Beneficial Owners Nationality&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nationality of beneficial owners in the UK register&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of nationality, we also have information on where beneficial owners live. The vast majority are based in the UK, with 183,000, or 13% of the total, living overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the arguments made against creating these registers is that companies would find it very difficult to identify their beneficial owners, but this doesn’t appear to be the case. In only 2% of cases did companies say that they were struggling to identify a beneficial owner or collect the right information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just under ten percent of companies claimed to have no beneficial owner. This is possible under the legislation, because you have to own at least 25 percent of a company to be considered its beneficial owner. We think that’s quite a high threshold, which could be exploited by people looking to stay under the radar So we will be digging a bit deeper to see whether companies are trying to avoid disclosing information that they should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;max-width:900px&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-EVcm0&quot; src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EVcm0/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;196&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&quot;undefined&quot;==typeof window.datawrapper&amp;&amp;(window.datawrapper={}),window.datawrapper[&quot;EVcm0&quot;]={},window.datawrapper[&quot;EVcm0&quot;].embedDeltas={&quot;100&quot;:196,&quot;200&quot;:196,&quot;300&quot;:196,&quot;400&quot;:196,&quot;500&quot;:196,&quot;600&quot;:196,&quot;700&quot;:196,&quot;800&quot;:196,&quot;900&quot;:196,&quot;1000&quot;:196},window.datawrapper[&quot;EVcm0&quot;].iframe=document.getElementById(&quot;datawrapper-chart-EVcm0&quot;),window.datawrapper[&quot;EVcm0&quot;].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[&quot;EVcm0&quot;].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[&quot;EVcm0&quot;].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+&quot;px&quot;,window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,function(a){if(&quot;undefined&quot;!=typeof a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var b in a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])&quot;EVcm0&quot;==b&amp;&amp;(window.datawrapper[&quot;EVcm0&quot;].iframe.style.height=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][b]+&quot;px&quot;)});&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 30 beneficial owners have been successfully granted the right to keep their name off the register due to concerns about their security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also able to build up a picture of company networks. These were only partial insights as we were working with just three months’ worth of data, but it gave us an idea of what was possible, and to start to understand complex corporate structures. Complexity doesn’t necessarily indicate wrongdoing. For example below is a partial map of Reckitt Benckiser, the healthcare company that makes Durex condoms among other things. However, it will provide a much better map of how UK companies structure themselves, and in some cases connections between companies may raise further questions about what they have been up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org//media/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-18_at_14.31.23.width-1280.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reckitt Benckiser&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The UK control structure of Reckitt Benckiser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flaws&quot;&gt;Flaws&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably with a bold experiment like this, there will be problems with the data, despite the generally excellent job that Companies House has done. The flaws that we identified split into two categories: messy data due to how it was collected, and examples of what look like non-compliance with the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big problems we found was that Companies House allows for free text entry for a number of fields. For example, we found over 500 different ways of putting “British”. Our favourite were the 10 beneficial owners who described themselves as Cornish. We were able to get around this by creating a nationality mapping table. However, an easy way to avoid this would be for Companies House to use drop down menus for fields such as nationality or title, with a potential “other box”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/media/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-18_at_14.19.07.width-1280.png&quot; alt=&quot;Many ways of spelling British&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The many ways of spelling “British” in the UK beneficial ownership register&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big challenge is the lack of unique identifiers for individuals and some companies. We were relying on using name and day and month of birth to try and identify individuals. This is fine if you’re someone with an unusual name, but proves more tricky for the John Smiths or Mohammed Iqbals of this world. We’d like to work with Companies House on thinking about how they could get around this problem. One solution could be to assign beneficial owners a unique number to allow better cross-matching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also 2,160 beneficial owners born in 2016. Now either these are a very precocious bunch of toddlers or the data has been entered incorrectly. We also had people who listed 9988 as their year of birth - clearly a visitor from the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of these data validation issues, we found a number of signs of non-compliance with the law. For example, 9,800 companies listed their beneficial owner as a foreign company. Now this is possible if the foreign company was listed on one of the stock exchanges deemed equivalent to the UK system (e.g. the US, EU and Japanese exchanges). However, we found almost 3,000 companies with tax haven addresses listed as beneficial owners. This is not allowed under the rules. We’ll be handing this list of companies over to Companies House to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;max-width:900px&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-OpOKm&quot; src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OpOKm/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;351&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&quot;undefined&quot;==typeof window.datawrapper&amp;&amp;(window.datawrapper={}),window.datawrapper[&quot;OpOKm&quot;]={},window.datawrapper[&quot;OpOKm&quot;].embedDeltas={&quot;100&quot;:485,&quot;200&quot;:418,&quot;300&quot;:385,&quot;400&quot;:385,&quot;500&quot;:351,&quot;600&quot;:351,&quot;700&quot;:351,&quot;800&quot;:351,&quot;900&quot;:351,&quot;1000&quot;:351},window.datawrapper[&quot;OpOKm&quot;].iframe=document.getElementById(&quot;datawrapper-chart-OpOKm&quot;),window.datawrapper[&quot;OpOKm&quot;].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[&quot;OpOKm&quot;].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[&quot;OpOKm&quot;].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+&quot;px&quot;,window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,function(a){if(&quot;undefined&quot;!=typeof a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var b in a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])&quot;OpOKm&quot;==b&amp;&amp;(window.datawrapper[&quot;OpOKm&quot;].iframe.style.height=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][b]+&quot;px&quot;)});&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of these examples it’s not clear whether this is because the people filing the information didn’t understand the new system, or whether there’s something more sinister going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;investigation&quot;&gt;Investigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key arguments in favour of creating this register was that law enforcement, civil society and journalists could use it to uncover wrongdoing. We didn’t expect to find any slam dunk cases in just a weekend, but we did find a few interesting leads. Because the UK register is available as open data, we could compare it to other data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial findings suggest 19 senior politicians (known as politically exposed persons), 76 people from the U.S. sanctions list and 267 disqualified directors were listed as beneficial owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these matches were based on name and month and year of birth. This means that it’s hard to be certain that the matches are good ones. Any leads coming out of the new register will have to be followed up with more traditional investigative digging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had an initial look at comparing the beneficial ownership to government spending information. It was challenging given that a lot of the spending information doesn’t have proper identification for companies (for example it would be good to include company numbers). But we did find a number of recipients of government contracts who had beneficial owners based in tax havens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As campaigners who have worked for years to get this information out in the public domain, the weekend was an exciting first opportunity to get our hands dirty and start to tell some stories. The work was only possible because the UK government made the decision to make the register free and accessible to all as open data. This is an important lesson for other countries who are thinking about creating similar registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably the data was messy, partly due to how the register is set up and partly due to confusion from those providing data. We’re going to be working with Companies House on ironing out some of these issues. Hopefully as the register beds in, these kinks will get ironed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big question that we weren’t able to answer was whether people had lied to the register or provided inaccurate information. This is going to be a serious challenge for the credibility of the register, and the government will have to provide more reassurances on how they’re going to ensure data accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’re hoping that other governments will see the potential of what the UK has done. The process will be difficult, but if our weekend showed us anything, it’s that this is incredibly useful information to have.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why we published the data behind Hostile Takeover</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post was originally posted on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/why-we-published-data-behind-hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;Global Witness website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will come as no shock to Cambodians that their ruling elite has amassed vast fortunes whilst in power. As our report, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/reports/hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shows, members of Prime Minister Hun Sen’s family have business interests spanning the majority of the country’s major industries. While 40% of Cambodians live below or close to the poverty line, the Hun family have a combined wealth estimated to total between US$ 500 million and US$ 1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But until fairly recently it has been extremely difficult for activists and campaigners to prove this with hard facts and solid data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has enabled the country’s most powerful family to continue to line its pockets behind a wall of secrecy. It has also allowed international companies and investors to establish business relationships with members of Hun Sen’s family, either unaware of or unconcerned by previous allegations of corruption and human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-the-original-dataset&quot;&gt;Limitations of the original dataset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of data by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moc.gov.kh/en-us/&quot;&gt;Cambodia’s Ministry of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; was a step towards greater transparency. The data held the key to the extensive business interests of Cambodia’s ruling elite, exposing just how much of a grip Hun Sen and his family have over the nation’s economy. However, in its original form the data was unusable for investigative purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we commend the Ministry of Commerce for publishing the data in the first place, the information provided suffered from a number of issues that prevented our researchers from using it effectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The database was put behind a login, making it difficult to programmatically access&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search portal didn’t allow people to download the dataset in its entirety&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The service and availability of information changed from time to time. This posed a risk to our research that data would be taken offline or modified without our knowledge. Since the publication of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/reports/hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report - for instance - shareholder information has been removed completely&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry’s servers were slow and unreliable, making it difficult to conduct in-depth research&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these limitations we extracted the contents of the database and developed our own version with the functionality needed to support in-depth investigation. This is known as “web scraping” by techies, and it is becoming an essential process in a wide-range of investigations at Global Witness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-data-and-network-effects&quot;&gt;Open data and network effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Global Witness we passionately believe that our investigations should be a platform for change. We are well aware, however, that the kinds of changes we want to see can only be achieved when we work through networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to data and technology this means enabling a range of actors - from civil society groups to law enforcement - to use the databases we’ve built up and the technology we’ve developed to verify our findings and spot things we haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what we did for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/reports/hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We have published both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;dataset that we extracted&lt;/a&gt; from the Ministry of Commerce in its entirety and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;the research tool&lt;/a&gt; we developed to interrogate this information including the underlying &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/cambodia-corporates&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;. We have applied &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendefinition.org/&quot;&gt;open licenses&lt;/a&gt; to all of these so anyone can freely access, remix and build on our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodian newspaper &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/&quot;&gt;The Phnom Penh Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; made great use of the data almost immediately after we launched our report. As well as publishing their own analysis of the data we provided, they also produced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/inside-hun-familys-business-empire#interactive&quot;&gt;playful interactive&lt;/a&gt; letting readers explore the wide-ranging business interests of the Hun Sen family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/inside-hun-familys-business-empire&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/media/images/Screen_Shot_2016-08-19_at_10.17.02.width-500.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cambodia Wheel of Fortune&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By publishing our data openly we also want it to be re-used in some of the game-changing aggregation and search services being built by civic-hackers and tech-for-good enterprises like &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencorporates.com/&quot;&gt;OpenCorporates&lt;/a&gt;. Powerful, free tools for investigative journalists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.occrp.org/&quot;&gt;data.occrp.org&lt;/a&gt; benefit hugely from organisations choosing to open their data post-publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools and this pooling of information is ever more important for anti-corruption campaigners who - in their attempts to unravel global illicit financial flows - need to be able to join the dots between fragmented and siloed datasets. In the same way that medical researchers across the world leverage the technology, data and methods of their peers to defeat deadly diseases, the fight against corruption could benefit from a far more joined up investigative community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But openness isn’t just a practical matter for us, it’s also a principle. As an organisation that asks governments and companies around the world to do more of their work in the open where it can be scrutinised by the public, we believe that once we’ve published a story, and where no risks exist for our sources, we should publish the data we’ve collected as permissibly as possible. We invite others to verify our findings and scrutinise our methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being able to conduct searches for companies and directors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;Cambodia Corporates&lt;/a&gt; has a number of functions not available on the original site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuzzy search for names - It’s a common problem in many datasets that names for the same person are spelt differently on different records. This is particularly problematic in cases where names have been. transliterated from Roman script. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;Cambodia Corporates&lt;/a&gt; let’s you introduce “fuzziness” into your search by choosing the number of characters that the results can vary from your original search term&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the nationality of chairpersons - The Ministry of Commerce website doesn’t allow you to look at the nationality of the chairperson of Cambodian registered companies. This is important information for understanding international investment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download all the data - There are many colleagues and researchers out there who will want to do things with the information that we haven’t anticipated. Perhaps they will want to combine it with other databases they are building. We also want to enable those building excellent registries and search tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencorporates.com&quot;&gt;OpenCorproates&lt;/a&gt; and OCCRP (&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.occrp.org&quot;&gt;data.occrp.org&lt;/a&gt;) to connect to this information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/cambodia-corporates&quot;&gt;Get the source code&lt;/a&gt; - For the geeks amongst you, you can download, tweak and re-deploy our source code for similar projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following the publication of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/reports/hostile-takeover/&quot;&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the Ministry of Commerce database no longer contains the shareholder data that our investigation was built on. The reasons as to why this data is no longer available are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/government-scrubs-database-exposed-hun-family-riches-116772/&quot;&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt;. This important information is currently only available from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorporates.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;Cambodia Corporates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access the fully functional research tool and the attached database of companies and directors at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambodiacorproates.globalwitness.org&quot;&gt;https://cambodiacorproates.globalwitness.org&lt;/a&gt;, the underlying source code is available on GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Global-Witness/cambodia-corporates&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A quick look at offshore property ownership in England &amp; Wales</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The ownership of properties and land in England and Wales by companies registered in overseas countries has come under significant scrutiny in recent months. Reports by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/mystery-baker-street/&quot;&gt;Global Witness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8340483/A-look-round-the-London-house-thought-to-be-owned-by-Libyas-Saif-al-Islam-Gaddafi.html&quot;&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/04/uk-properties-held-by-offshore-firms-used-in-global-corruption-say-police&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.private-eye.co.uk/registry&quot;&gt;Private Eye&lt;/a&gt; have shown that offshore ownership can be a convenient means to launder the proceeds of crime and corruption. As it turns out, it is also a convenient mechanism to avoid tax assocaited with buying and selling a property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saplaw.co.uk/uk-legal-services/commercial-lawyers-london/commercial-lawyers-articles/using-an-offshore-company-to-buy-and-sell-uk-residential-property&quot;&gt;telling article&lt;/a&gt; on the website of a UK based solicitors lists the potential “tax advantages” of this approach to trading UK property. I quote directly from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saplaw.co.uk/uk-legal-services/commercial-lawyers-london/commercial-lawyers-articles/using-an-offshore-company-to-buy-and-sell-uk-residential-property&quot;&gt;the site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Regardless of who owns the property any rental income will remain taxable in the UK. If the property is owned by an offshore company only the basic rate of UK income tax (20%) will apply regardless of the level of income.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“A property can be sold by selling the shares in the company with no UK Capital Gains Tax.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“If the property is in the name of an individual then on their death inheritance tax is potentially payable on the net value of the property.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“No stamp duty land tax is payable by a buyer of the shares in the company.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that we’re in the midst of a housing crisis, and with tenants in London paying on average &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/16/tenants-in-england-spend-half-their-pay-on-rent&quot;&gt;72% of their gross income&lt;/a&gt;, the fact that so much property is not subject to normal UK tax law seems particualrly unjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/land-registry-overseas-companies-data&quot;&gt;data published by the Land Registry in March 2016&lt;/a&gt;. It contains information on all freeholds and leasholds owned by companies registered overseas. The data is accurate as of 31st October 2015. It contains almost 100,000 leaseholds addresses and includes information on tenure, date of purchase, price paid and if there are multiple owners. This data was made available in response to increasing pressue from civil society groups for greater transparency in the property market and some well-publicised &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.private-eye.co.uk/registry&quot;&gt;Freedom of Information requests concerning the extent of offshore ownership of land and property in England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;little-data-available-on-price-but-as-an-estimate&quot;&gt;Little data available on price, but as an estimate…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know from this information that at least £10.1 billion of land and property is owned by overseas company. Considering that only 7% of these properties contains price paid data, that’s a staggering figure. We can only approximate what the total value might be for all leaseholds and freeholds in the database. Given that the average price of these freeholds and leasholds is £1,512,032 we might expect the total figure to be around the £150 billion mark. This is substantially higher than the esimate given by the Financial Times in 2015 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6cb11114-18aa-11e4-a51a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz46ls5rtpE&quot;&gt;£122 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-about-secrecy-and-tax&quot;&gt;It’s about secrecy and tax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the top 10 countries through which these properties are owned. These are the archetypal tax havens and secrecy jursidictions. Half of them rank in the top 20 most secretive jurisdictions in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results&quot;&gt;Tax Justice Network’s Financial Secrecy Index&lt;/a&gt;. This quite clearly is not about foreign nationals and normal overseas companies owning property in England and Wales, but rather the deliberate choice to use jurisidctions renowned for low tax rates and corproate secrecy to buy and sell property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JNsPc/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;343&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-vast-majority-of-overseas-ownership-is-in-greater-london&quot;&gt;The vast majority of overseas ownership is in Greater London&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, overseas ownership of property and land is concentrated in the South East and Greater London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AFgqt/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;433&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discredited-companies-use-overseas-ownership-extensively&quot;&gt;Discredited companies use overseas ownership extensively&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the top 5 companies that make most extensive use of offshore purchasing of land, we see that one of them, Profitable Plots, has been caught up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/news/7436428/Green-Belt-housing-scheme-promoted-by-footballers-leaves-investors-in-the-red.html&quot;&gt;a scandal that involved cheating investors for just short of a million dollars&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly not all people who use offshore property ownership are out to scam, but the level of secrecy afforded to companies incorporated in places like the British Virgin Islands is an invitation to all sorts of nefarious activity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Something is rotten in the state of Denmark</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;aligned intro&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Originally posted at on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalwitness.org/en/blog/something-rotten-state-denmark/&quot;&gt;Global Witness blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A compelling new Danish drama does a stellar job at portraying some of the mechanisms of corruption that we at Global Witness are all too familiar with.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re big fans of the new Danish TV series &lt;i&gt;Follow the Money&lt;/i&gt;. It’s a great piece of drama, but we’re also fascinated because it’s a case of fiction mirroring reality right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone following our work, the script used in &lt;i&gt;Follow the Money&lt;/i&gt; will be familiar. A small set of wealthy individuals use the secrecy afforded by offshore jurisdictions to hide and channel illicit funds at the expense of everyday people and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://globalwitness.org/media/images/Energreen.width-300.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tells another important story, which often gets lost. Corruption isn’t something that just affects fragile states and dictatorships, it’s far closer to home than many Western governments like to admit. As our work has shown time and time again, Western companies, law firms and banks are key enablers for moving dirty cash around the world and covering up secret deals, and their governments could be doing much more to put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact Denmark seems like the perfect setting to make this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number one in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015&quot;&gt;Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, Denmark does not suffer from the kind of grand corruption that plagues those at the bottom of the Index like Cambodia or Afghanistan. However, such is the structure of the global financial system today, Danish companies and citizens, like those in any other European country, can use networks of offshore subsidiaries to hide and launder illicit funds whilst retaining the veneer of corporate respectability that being based in a center of global finance affords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services offered in places like the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands can be used to hide wealth from tax authorities, deceive law enforcement agencies and introduce huge levels of risk to unwitting investors. We’ve seen some these mechanisms at play in our recent investigations into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/mystery-baker-street/&quot;&gt;London property market&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/shell-and-enis-misadventures-nigeria/&quot;&gt;acquisition of one of West Africa’s largest oil blocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fictional, cut-throat energy firm at the heart of the plot, Energreen, uses a number of these ploys to devastating effect. Below are three of the top ways in which its activities mirror the companies we often investigate:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-exposing-anonymous-companies-could-cut-down-on-crime-global-witness&quot;&gt;Anonymous shell companies&lt;/a&gt; are the currency of the corrupt&lt;/b&gt; - Energreen and its insider traders use a network of subsidiaries whose true owners are hidden in order to siphon off funds and fraudulently pump up the value of its own assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secrecy jurisdictions and tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands are conduits for illicit financial flows&lt;/b&gt; - The network of subsidiaries used by Energreen are often based in offshore secrecy jurisdictions deliberately obscuring critical information about the company from law enforcement, the public and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corruption affects us all&lt;/b&gt; - Energreen’s eventual collapse after it goes public leaves a huge range of investors exposed including pension funds used by everyday people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/david-cameron-majority-british-public-want-you-act-tax-havens/&quot;&gt;two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; this is a problem that the UK can help to fix by taking action on the UK Territories. For our readers based in the UK, you can watch all 10 episodes of &lt;i&gt;Follow the Money&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072h7rk&quot;&gt;BBC iPlayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

        <title>Google Trends in tax avoidance and tax evasion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Panama Leaks have shaken the foundations of British politics and done substantial reputational damage to a range of high-profile personalities around the world. We’ve seen plenty of revelations concerning corrupt and morally questionable practices of political elites over the past few years from ICIJ’s Offshore Leaks to the Wikileaks Diplomatic Cables, but few have piqued the interest of the public in the way the Panama Leaks have. Google summed this up nicely in the following chart measuring searches for two of the most significant leaks in recent years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/480_RC06/embed_loader.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
trends.embed.renderWidget(&quot;GB_cu_rWzp4FMBAAAXDM_en&quot;, &quot;fe_line_chart_1752a923-477e-48a9-8e0f-02d189530086&quot;, {&quot;guestPath&quot;:&quot;https://www.google.co.uk:443/trends/embed/&quot;});
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-wing newspapers that normally shy away from articles on tax justice have covered the Leaks at length often leading with them on their front page. As an anti-corruption campaigner, I’m hopeful that these revelations could turn the tide of public opinion on key issues around corporate accountability and tax justice. Both are issues that tend not to get the attention they deserve in part due to the relative complexity of the stories that explore them. I’m curious to see if the Panama Leaks and the associated coverage have made a breakthrough and mainstreamed these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a look at Google Trends which lets you compare the popularity of certain search terms over time, a decent metric of the level of public interest in a given topic. The immediate effect on awareness of the related issues is clear, but how this translates into concrete reform, behaviour change and what people demand at the ballot box is yet to be seen. Surely though, there is reason to be optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;//www.google.co.uk/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;amp;q=%22tax+evasion%22,+%22tax+avoidance%22&amp;amp;cmpt=q&amp;amp;tz=Etc/GMT-1&amp;amp;tz=Etc/GMT-1&amp;amp;content=1&amp;amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;amp;export=5&amp;amp;w=780&amp;amp;h=330&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s notable that “tax avoidance” as a search term had a significant spike in June 2012 when Jimmy Carr’s use of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/19/tax-scheme-jimmy-carr-hmrc&quot;&gt;“K2” tax avoidance scheme&lt;/a&gt; received press attention. As ever, the celebrity status  of the scalp claimed in the exposé drives public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is the NHS safe in Cameron's hands?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the government’s increasingly bitter dispute with Junior Doctors rolls on to the backdrop of a critically overstretched health service, it’s difficult to see how David Cameron can back up his words during the 2015 election campaign that NHS is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itv.com/news/update/2015-05-18/david-cameron-the-nhs-is-safe-in-my-hands/&quot;&gt;“safe in my hands”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data published by NHS England appears to show A&amp;amp;E waiting times slipping to new lows as patients in need of emergency care wait longer to be admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hallmarks of the the New Labour years was a focus on performance targets in public service particualry the NHS. This drew criticism from Conservatives and accusations of public sector bodies gaming the system. It’s interesting to observe that when it comes to A&amp;amp;E waiting times, a loosening of targets has coincided with a steep drop in the number of patients waiting less than 4 hours in A&amp;amp;E.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition government on taking the reigns in 2010 reduced the target for the proportion of A&amp;amp;E attendees being seen in under 4 hours from 98% to 95%. Despite the lower bar, the NHS under the Conservatives appears unable to achieve this as demonstrated by the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ivf9S/1/&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;748&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a similar story when it comes to the number of patients waiting 12 hours or more from decision to admit to admission.  Although still relatively small, the numbers have been steadily rising since 2010, with an unexplained spike in December 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://charts.datawrapper.de/6OOHu/index.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscreen&quot; width=&quot;748&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In poking around the public data available on NHS performance, I found a worrying lack of consistency in the reporting between administrations. On top of this, the A&amp;amp;E waiting list data pre-2010 appears not to have been properly archived and as such is no longer available to the public. These historical data gaps make it harder to compare the performance of subsequent governments and truly assess key election pledges around the protection of essential public services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the data that is available and in-depth studies of it by &lt;a href=&quot;http://qmr.kingsfund.org.uk/2016/18/&quot;&gt;groups like the King’s Fund&lt;/a&gt; [2] paint a damning picture that put the lie to Cameron’s “safe in my hands” line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Have targets improved NHS performance? - The King’s Fund &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/general-election-2010/key-election-questions/performance-targets&quot;&gt;http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/general-election-2010/key-election-questions/performance-targets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open data at Global Witness in 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;em&gt;Cross-posted for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/open-data-can-make-world-better-place-only-if-we-know-how-use-it/&quot;&gt;Global Witness blog&lt;/a&gt; where it was first published.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;aligned intro&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a self-confessed data junkie, but I appreciate that spreadsheets aren’t everyone’s idea of fun. Most people want their digested data packaged up into compelling stories and beautiful visuals. My job here at Global Witness is to do exactly that - tooling up the organisation and its partners so that we can take the troves of data we have access to and ask the questions of it that will help us create positive change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is a very exciting time to be doing this. As the explosion of powerful, free data analysis tools intersects with our own efforts to bring business into the open, we’re seeing exciting new opportunities to help cut poverty and financial crime all over the world. The challenge, as we see it, is to find the right tools and equip the right people so that all this information can be translated into genuine accountability for those in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is already a lot of valuable data relevant to our mission in the public domain. For example, billions of dollars worth of company-to-government payments are now published each year as part of the Publish What You Pay initiative that Global Witness helped to found. Elsewhere, recent US legislation means thousands of companies who use minerals in their products routinely publish information on their supply chains, to make sure they aren’t sponsoring conflict or bloodshed where the raw materials are mined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as laws demanding information be published, there are non-profit organisations which exist to collect data and make it useful. &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencorporates.com/&quot;&gt;OpenCorporates&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s largest free database of corporate data, now contains the records of over of 97 million companies from around the world. MySociety’s nascent &lt;a href=&quot;http://everypolitician.org/&quot;&gt;EveryPolitician.org &lt;/a&gt;contains the records of over 60,000 politicians from over 232 companies which have been scraped and crowdsourced from numerous digital sources. Our friends at OpenOil now have a service which provides free access over one million company filings related to the oil, gas and mining industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;display:inline-block;text-align:center;float:right&quot;&gt;	
&lt;img src=&quot;https://globalwitness.org/media/images/Screen_Shot_2016-02-17_at_16.10.14.width-300.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;162&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot;/&gt;
&lt;figcaption style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:8px&quot;&gt;Visualisation from Open Oil's &lt;br&gt; vast database of contracts from Nigeria's byzantine &lt;br&gt; oil industry: &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.openoil.net/#nigeria_production&quot;&gt;https://data.openoil.net/#nigeria_production&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data could revolutionise the way journalists and NGOs like Global Witness expose the corrupt networks that deprive some of the world’s poorest people of the wealth beneath their feet. But for that to happen, the data needs to be actively monitored and mined by groups equipped with the right skills and tools. This analysis is especially valuable in states with limited political will or capacity to undertake their own corruption investigations, as is the case in many countries where Global Witness works. So the opportunities are obvious, but it’s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single public dataset is likely to unearth substantial corruption on its own. The real value tends to come when these datasets are combined in ways not anticipated by the publisher. For example, combining port records with company information has allowed us to show how the EU’s demand for illegal timber from the DRC undermines efforts to protect the world’s second largest rainforest. Elsewhere, company filings from multiple jurisdictions helped piece together the corrupt and complex deal behind the sale of Nigeria’s largest oil block, which deprived its citizens of over one billion US dollars. The more data that is available on companies and governments in a standardised form, the greater the opportunity for linking this information in meaningful ways to fight corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;display:inline-block;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://globalwitness.org/media/images/Screen_Shot_2016-02-17_at_15.48.22.width-1280.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:8px&quot;&gt;A screenshot of Global Witness’s Timber Trade Tracker built in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;http://okfn.org/&quot;&gt;Open Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; that visualises the flows of illegal timber out of the DRC. The data is updated on a quarterly basis: &lt;a href=&quot;http://drctimbertracker.globalwitness.org/&quot;&gt;http://drctimbertracker.globalwitness.org/ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we stop all this data from becoming an overwhelming deluge of information? This is where the tools developed by civic hackers and socially minded tech firms come in. Take the tools for cross-checking lists of names against databases of “politically exposed people” (PEPs) now being developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en&quot;&gt;OCCRP&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://influencemapping.org/&quot;&gt;Influence Mapping&lt;/a&gt; community. These are invaluable instruments in identifying conflicts of interest and corruption in the allocation of lucrative natural resources. Free software like &lt;a href=&quot;http://openrefine.org/&quot;&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/a&gt; puts powerful data processing algorithms at the fingertips of non-programmers and tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;Python-Pandas&lt;/a&gt; , initially developed for the finance industries but now open source, let people manipulate spreadsheets millions of rows long. We put these tools to use in combination in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalwitness.org/en-gb/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/myanmarjade/&quot;&gt;our recent Myanmar jade investigation&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://opencorporates.com&quot;&gt;OpenCorporates&lt;/a&gt; data to help show how this vast trade is monopolised by a military elite at the expense of some of Myanmar’s most vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;display:inline-block;text-align:center;float:left&quot;&gt;	
&lt;img src=&quot;https://globalwitness.org/media/images/The-Great-Rip-Off-The-BVI-Effect-copy.width-300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;162&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot;/&gt;
&lt;figcaption style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:8px&quot;&gt;Secrecy for sale in the British Virgin Islands as &lt;br&gt; visualised in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatripoffmap.globalwitness.org/#!/&quot;&gt;Great Rip Off Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say we shouldn’t also work tirelessly to improve the data that’s already out there. Existing sources of public data are far from perfect, and in many countries online access to public records still remains a distant dream. Lack of standardisation makes information difficult to retrieve and connect. The secrecy for sale in the world’s tax havens means that many corporate structures used to funnel the proceeds of corruption remain hidden. Global Witness will continue to push for those gaps to be filled and input into developing strong, open and workable standards along with our partners in groups such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/&quot;&gt;Publish What You Pay&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://financialtransparency.org/&quot;&gt;Financial Transparency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open-contracting.org/&quot;&gt;Open Contracting&lt;/a&gt; coalitions. And alongside our data work, we will be lobbying decision-makers to ensure that transparency becomes the expected norm in how the world does its business.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open data revolution shows no sign of slowing in 2016. This year even more data will go online as hundreds of UK companies release project-level information on all payments to governments in the oil, gas and mining industries under new EU law. From July onwards all UK companies will be forced to publish who their real owners are in publicly accessible register, something that Global Witness has been fighting for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figcaption style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:8px&quot;&gt;OpenCorporates' proof-of-concept of a global beneficial &lt;br&gt;ownership registry: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alpha.whocontrolsit.com/&quot;&gt;http://alpha.whocontrolsit.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;aligned&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who wants to fight corruption and build a more open, just society, this is really exciting. For a data geek like me, it’s doubly so. But as the possibilities grow, so does the work involved in mining all the data, and we’re far from the only ones driving this. This week in Lima, I’ll be working with activists from all over the world to look at how they can apply these tools and techniques to their different contexts, and help make sure the new availability of information brings justice and accountability from their governments. Together we’ll be trawling this new information for insights and leads, so that the individuals and systems that perpetuate conflict, corruption and environmental devastation have no place to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
